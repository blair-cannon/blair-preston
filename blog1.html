                    <b> <u>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not? </u></b>
<br> 
There are a lot of aspects to this question! To start, I was comforted by the transparency in the coming journey of learning to code. The explanation of 'The Path' shared by fellow coders as they learned the same information was unexpected insight on the coming months. It feels good to have a sneak peak of the ups and downs in my confidence and competency and to know that 
1. I won't be alone in feeling lost or confused.
2. More importantly: There is light (awesomeness) at the end of the tunnel.
Otherwise, my first week has been similar to what I have been expecting. Knowing myself, I knew I would have lots of questions. I like to understand every aspect of a topic and undestand the WHY behind doing each step. Thus, as expected, I have already put Google and Justin to work helping me along the way. It has felt good to be my own guide to learning and to finally figure out a tedious detail after researching and doing trial and error strategies to figure something out, super satisfying! That feeling was an additional unexpected part of my first week--I'm excited to find more of those breakthroughs. 
<br>
<b> <u>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</u></b>
<br>
I'm excited to learn more in general and uncover more aspects of coding than I understand at the moment. I'm excited to get more of a feel for what a future job might entail as I am more exposed to different uses and capabilities that coding can be used for in our world. To say something more specific, I am excited for the back end skill weeks because I feel like it is the most foreign of the concepts and it will be interesting to see what it entails. 
<br>
<b> <u>What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?</u></b>
<br>
Have you ever been so close to something before deciding to jump ship? Well, Hi. I'm Blair Preston and I was addicted to being the perfect pre-med student. Shadowing, volunteering, research, leardership, patient-contact hours, academics--you name it and the steps are engrained in my head. Anyways, to begin the comedy of my past year, I went as far as taking the MCAT, applying to five medical schools in the US, and interviewing before actually giving myself the option of not having to go. I think I had known for a while that the path I was on wasn't a part of my dream life anymore, but I was really good at blinding myself from that reality. In a toxic way, it is easy to see now that I felt like I had to prove to myself that I could check all of the boxes to go medical school. I didn't want to change because it was too hard or too much to handle, so I stayed. ANYWAYS PART 2, after spending the unrefundable application money, I finally let myself consider other optioins for my future and really thought about what was important to me as I moved forward. I haven't felt this excited for my future in a long time and it feels great. So, by reading my blog you can get the inside scoop as I use what's left of my post-MCAT brain to learn something totally outside of the 'healthcare ship' that I was stuck in. It should be interesting.
