                    <b><u>What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?</u></b>
                    <br>
                    I really felt the effects of 'jumping off the cliff' this week. We were introduced to object oriented programming (OOP) this week and had lots of conversations and reading materials devoted to understanding classes and inheritance. Thus, for our project this week I wanted to try and do the Javascript project using objects and see if I could apply the knowledge that we were going over. There were lots more to learn about OOP in order to complete this project that I didn't yet understand. In the end, the deep dive into sticking to OOP furthered my understanding and stamina to seek answers, fix errors, and solve problems in programming. At the same time, this also held me back in that my code was not where I wanted it to be by the time we presented in the bootcamp. I had a few refactoring goals that were a part of the minimum viable product requirements that were not yet reached even though the stretch goal of using OOP was reached. This was a valuable lesson on the importance of keeping the end in mind and although you can still plan for and anticipate future refactoring, the basic requirments for the product are the first priority so it is important to not get sidetracked. There were many great lessons this week.

                    <b><u>What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?</u></b>
                    <br>
                    I would like to learn how to apply the dot and bracket methods to JSON data as so far I only understand the use for objects that are created within the repo rather than outside data.

                    <b><u>How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?</u></b>
                    <br>
                    Bootcamp has been even more rewarding than imagined. I leave inspired everyday to prosper in this field and to use the remaining weeks of Bootcamp to the best of my ability. In-person Bootcamp has been great for collaborating with the other students and for providing a closer view on actual developer coding and how the instructors solve problems and think through projects. I am excited to be a part of such a healthy learning environment and I feel confident that I am going to leave Awesome Inc confident in the skills I have aquired.

                    <b><u>What is your “Why”?</u></b>
                    <br>
                    There is never a better time to start investing in yourself than the now. 
                    After a long period of restrictions and fear I put around leaving the path I made for myself when I was 17 choosing a major for myself going into college, I finally decided to take the leap of faith. I have always known the importance of flexibility and growth to my fiance and I as we plan for the future. Financial stability, adventure, spiritual growth, parenthood, and living to the fullest are all priorities that we have held since we were 17. I am so grateful for the opportunity to be working towards a career that has so much potential for the freedom and expansion in my life. I already know that the Bootcamp is going to be one of the biggest blessings in my life.
